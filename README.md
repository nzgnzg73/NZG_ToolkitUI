NZG Official - Stable Version of chatter-box-dubbing
This repository is a modified and stable copy of the
 original project, [ChatterboxToolkitUI](https://github.com/dasjoms/ChatterboxToolkitUI/tree/master)

üõë Important Explanation: Reason for Re-uploading this Code


I, the owner of NZG Official, sincerely apologize to the original code owner, [dasjoms ](https://github.com/dasjoms)

 (( ‚úÖ [ChatterboxToolkitUI](https://github.com/dasjoms/ChatterboxToolkitUI/tree/master) ‚úÖ), and wish to clarify that my intention is not in any way to infringe upon your copyright or claim ownership of your work.
I decided to download your repository and re-upload it to my account solely due to personal need and technical constraints:
 * PC Limitations: I do not have a powerful enough (PC üò≠ üòî) to run the code you release locally. My computer is very old and lacks a suitable graphics card.
 * Colab Usage: My primary need is to use this code in the ‚ö°[Google Colab ](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16HI1ZW3GrrG0QUmeGvV79yoiaKCVNfxs?usp=sharing#scrollTo=SBubttdzrVBW) [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/core73/new-nzg-toolkitui-kaggle) ‚ö°
    environment.
 * Updates Conflict: When you release a new update or feature in the original repository, that new code often conflicts or stops working with my existing Colab setup.
 * My Goal: Therefore, I uploaded a stable version here for personal use so I can maintain a version of the code that runs continuously in Colab without constant daily fixing.

-   **Single Generation**:
    -   **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Generate high-quality speech from text using a reference audio file to clone the speaker's voice.
    -   **Voice Conversion (VC)**: Transfer the vocal characteristics of a reference speaker onto a source audio recording.
    -   **Parameter Sweeping**: Generate multiple variations of a single output at once by sweeping across a range of values for any generation parameter (e.g., Temperature, Pace, etc.).

-   **Batch Processing**:
    -   Process entire folders of prepared text or audio files in bulk with a single click.
    -   Optionally concatenate all generated files from a batch run into a single, continuous audio file.

-   **Data Preparation Suite**:
    -   **Text Splitter**: Automatically chunk long text documents into smaller, model-friendly segments based on sentence boundaries and a configurable character limit.
    -   **Audio Splitter**: Intelligently split long audio recordings into shorter clips by making cuts during periods of silence, with configurable duration and silence detection parameters.

-   **Workflow-Integrated Editing & Refinement**:
    -   **Regenerate Audio**: The "Regenerate" workflow allows you to review individual audio files from a batch run, send them back to the Single TTS tab with their original text and voice pre-loaded, tweak parameters, and replace the old file with the new-and-improved version.
    -   **Live Text Editor**: Directly edit the content of your processed text files within the UI and save the changes, perfect for making small script adjustments without leaving the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1.  **Python**: Version **3.11** is required.
2.  **Git**: For cloning the repository.
3.  **CUDA Compatible GPU**: For acceptable performance, a GPU is highly recommended. The underlying models will be extremely slow on a CPU.
4.  **FFmpeg**: This is a critical dependency for performing various audio processing tasks.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the ChatterboxToolkitUI on your local machine or use the ChatterboxToolkitUI.ipynb to run it in a colab environment.
